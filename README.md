# PyBer Analysis
Anaysis of ride-sharing data using various Python libraries. 

## Project Overview
This project is carried out to determine if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type for the individual scatter plots, and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types for each box-and-whisker plot.

## Tools
Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy

## Summary

### Pyber Summary Dataframe shows that:
- The number of rides in the urban cities are about 3 and 13 times more than the suburban and rural cities. Due to which the total 
sum of fares  is more in urban cities.
- Average fare per ride is less in the urban cities as compared to the  suburban and the rural cities.
- Average fare per driver in rural cities is about 1.5 and 3 times more than that of the suburban and urban cities.
- Total sum of fares in the urban cities is about 2 and 9 times  more as compared to the suburban and urban cities.
- The number of drivers in the urban cities are 5 and 30 times more as compared to the suburban and the rural cities.


### Summary of multiple-line plot for the sum of the fares for each city type:
- The plot shows that the sum of fares for urban cities was more than $1700 from Jan 2019 to April 2019 which is more than 
3 times the sum of fares (max value) of the rural cities. The sum of the fares for the suburban was less than $1500 during Jan-April 2019. 
- The maximum fares was during middle of Feb 2019  to the middle of April 2019 in the urban cities.
- During the month of Mar 2019, the sum of fares of the urban cities is at its peak whereas there is an opposite trend in the 
	 suburban and the rural cities.
